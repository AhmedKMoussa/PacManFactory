# PacMan-Factory

It's a funny project that have 2 buttons one to add a random PacMan icon and one to make then start moving and when press again make them moving faster.
Factory for making pacmen
You are given a starter.html code.
When button "make one" is pressed you need to complete the code
to position the new pacman image and add it to the "game" div. It is then added to the array of pacmen, which keeps track of the position and velocity of each pacman.
You also need to make each pacman bounce off any wall it hits.
Start by getting at least one pacman positioned and viewable.
